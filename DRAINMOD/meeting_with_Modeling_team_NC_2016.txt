##DRAINMOD-DSSAT
Modeling


#Model Componenets
>consist of3 model:
1. DRAINMOD
2. DRAINMOD-NII (takes outputs from DRAINMOD to model nitrogen )
3. CROP Models (we  choose DSSAT)
    - DSSAT is a modular structure

simulated in daily time step 
does not have user-friendly outface, so you have to manually change inputs

now DRAINMOD-NII and  DSSAT are subrutines of DRAINMOD


>DRAINMOD
field-scale model
simulates surface runoff, ET, water tables
the model was designe to simulate hydrology of poorly drained soil, could also simulate yield simplisticly 
origianl DRAINMOD could not take N stresses, climate change, crop rotation
- Was choosed because of the hydrology


>DRAINMOD-NII
- simulates nitrogen and C 
    - concentration of the N
- plant uptake of N was related to yield (percent of yield), but uptake changes day-by-day and can depend on soil water content
-  process-based vs imperical 
    - imperical will have fixed imperical esamption for yield

>Drawbacks
- late planting is not considered
- neglects the effect of changes in meteorological condistions on plant growth ..
-shortage of the DRAINMOD and NII was crop yield prediction 

>Calibration is done using N load
>Hardology should be calibrated the first, and then start with the N, and close enough estimation of the yield 
  >>>>hydrology data seems to be impoertant

>DSSAT
-it has its own hydrology, nitrogen and other components, but they took only cropping part of the model
- it cannot simulate well hydrology poorly-drained soils (do poor job in predicting yeild in poorly drained soil becasue of hydrology)
- can simmulate 26 crops


>NOW
-DRAINMOD-NII and DSSAT are subrutine of the DRAINMOD
-run DRAINMOD first, 
-than use weathere data (imput), PET (simulated), soil moisture(simulated), soil temp(simulated) as input in DSSAT
-effective root depth from DSSAT goes into DRAINMOD-NII, also N uptake and residue biomass uptake
-DRAINMOD  
- all Yield and Update is simulated daily by DSSAT, but you can still use the original way and write a fixed values for yield and N updated inputs 

>Management Input
-soil temperature is important for regions were soil can freeze because it effects N cycle
